# Bike-Rideshare-Customer-Insights-Interactive-Data-Story-
The project to analyze the data of Divvy, a Chicago City bike share company using Tableau for the year 2014-2021

	Data Visualization

The story was created to show the data exploration and an in-depth analysis of the rider behavior for the company Divvy. The story is constituted of various dashboards which are formed from several worksheets that depict a single analysis. The raw data was cleaned and transformed, and visualizations were generated using the transformed data in Tableau. The following visualizations and dashboard were created as a part of the story.

Dashboard for Overview of Divvy over the years
This dashboard presents an overview of the data of Divvy. It shows that till the year 2021, Divvy had 992 Stations and 6800 Bikes. The total rides are more than 23 million and on average each ride was around 20 minutes. The dashboard also has geo- the location of the stations on the map which can be zoomed in. It also presents insights about the number of rides over the year as well as the demographics of the members including the gender of the users and age group. It also gives an insight into the top five most used and underutilized stations.

Dashboard for a closer look at each station
This dashboard allows users to select a station and get insights about that station. The relative popularity of a station is its ranking according to the rides taken from the station. The first trip tile shows the date when the first ride was recorded from that station. The average duration is the duration of all the rides taken from that station. Trip activity by weekday and hour changes with each selection of the station. It also gives insights into how many incoming and outgoing trips are taken from a selected station. This shows if there is a deficit in the supply chain for a station.

Dashboard for a closer look at the data with each year

This helps in identifying how the pattern has changed over the years for the station usage and which areas have higher traffic.

Number of rides in the Year by the weekday
This visualization shows the trend in rides over the years according to the day of the week. It can be seen that the year 2021 and 2022 showed reverse trends over the weekends. Rides were more on Saturday and Sunday in the years 2021 and 2022 whereas in the previous year’s rides dropped on the weekends than the weekdays. One reason could be that people started using bikes for leisure during the pandemic whereas in the previous year’s more usage during the week indicated their use for going to work.
